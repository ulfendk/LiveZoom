# LiveZoom

A macOS screen zoom, annotation, and presentation tool inspired by ZoomIt for Windows.

## ⚠️ NB! First-Time Setup

When you first run LiveZoom (especially if built locally or downloaded), macOS Gatekeeper may prevent it from opening with a message like *"LiveZoom.app cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer"*.

**To authorize the app:**

1. **Locate the app** in Finder (usually in `~/Applications/` or `/Applications/`)
2. **Right-click (or Control-click)** on `LiveZoom.app`
3. Select **"Open"** from the context menu
4. In the dialog that appears, click **"Open"** again to confirm
5. The app will now run and be authorized for future launches

Alternatively, you can authorize it via System Settings:
1. Go to **System Settings** → **Privacy & Security**
2. Scroll down to find the message about LiveZoom being blocked
3. Click **"Open Anyway"**
4. Confirm by clicking **"Open"** in the dialog

After this one-time authorization, LiveZoom will launch normally in the future.
